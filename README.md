# JSON IO

A test Rust repository for dealing with JSON

## Goals
- Request, parse, and store data from the command line 
	- Format defined by schema.json? Makes it flexible.  Might be out of scope.
- Compress JSON data (similar to python's pickle) so data isn't sitting raw on disk
- Encryption? Stretch goal if everything else goes smoothly
